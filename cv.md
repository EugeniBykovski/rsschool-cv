3. I’m 24 years old. I’m looking for a job as a software developer.
It is important for me to strengthen my knowledge of layout,
deepen my knowledge in javascript, learn new frameworks and learn how to apply
programming patterns. I would also like to find a job in the field of web development.
I found myself in this and I want to connect my life with development.
In order to become an excellent specialist, I attended several programming courses
in JS (IBA, BellHard), constantly read various literature, and visit Internet sources.
I also improve my English level at English Papa. At the moment I have an
Intermediate level. My plus is that if something doesn’t work out for me, I definitely need to
thoroughly understand until I understand to the end.
